Backstube - Structure Saver
Designed to stream-line frequent changes to minecraft structures when developing them.


> **Warning:** The items are only available via the "/give @p ..."  command

This mod adds:
- the Structure Export Block
  - (a simplified and extended version of the Vanilla Strucute Block)
  - unlimited blocks
  - when exporting a structure e.g. "name1" it creates a backup of the previous version "name1_DATE_AND_TIME"
  > /give @p structuresaver:structure_export_blockitem

- the Structure Saver Item
  - quickly select two corners
  - export the structure (unlimited blocks)
  > /give @p structuresaver:structure_saver


This mod was created to supply one of my upcoming mods with a more convenient toolset to create Minecraft structures with no block limit.
However, the mod is independent and can be used standalone as well.

Roadmap:
- change Structure Saver to set size in Exporter block instead. R-click Exporter, right click outer corner
